<h3> Software Developer in the making </h3>


I'm a third year Computer Science student at [Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC-FIB)](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en) in Barcelona, Spain.

I mainly use C++ but I'm also able to work on C and SQL. Right now I am focusing on learning Web Development on self-study, although I'm mostly interested on the BackEnd part.
You can check my progress on the [Projects](https://github.com/Pecmecy/Projects) repository.


You can also check the latest Web Development project I've worked on directly [here](https://pecmecy.github.io).

<h3> Computer Science is fun (sometimes) </h3>

Being a Computer Science student requires a lot of work. That's why I decided to organize and save up everything I do throughout the degree.

Here is a list of the repositories focused on my university tasks and projects:
  * [Estructuras de Datos y Algoritmos](https://github.com/Pecmecy/FIB-EDA)
  * [ProgramaciÃ³n 1](https://github.com/Pecmecy/FIB-PRO1)
  * WIP ðŸš§
